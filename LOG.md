Wasted hours today to get Babylon + TS + yarn workspaces running. Many problems with paths and/or TS project references feature.
Then decided to use parcel in a single project to get things quickly running.

In the end Babylon stood in my way most of the time. I jsut wanted to create a basic structure to test and run some math.
I wanted to have an engien at hand to check the result but I'm still not happy.

Ditched everthing, now I try to implement myself the FOLD viewer. Based on SVG and looks easy. But it's written in coffee scripts
makes it hard to read. Let's see if I can implement the basic model "simple.fold"
